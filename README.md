# LinuxFork
Just another linux fork

## Purpose
The purpose of this distro is to give the power of linux readily available to uninitiated users. Taking only the best features from known linux distros, this OS aims to provide the best user experience as well as the most customisation to the user. Presets can be chosen upon installation, but the more experienced user may want to configure his system himself, which is also a possibility.
